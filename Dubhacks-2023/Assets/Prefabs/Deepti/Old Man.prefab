  - Welcome to our small village, traveler from afar.
  - I wish we could offer you a warmer welcome, but the ghosts plaguing us have become
    far too many.
  - Please, subdue these ghosts and bring them back to this cemetery so that they
    may finally rest peacefully...
  introHasGhostsTalking:
  - So eager to explore our little village, you walked right past me!
  - I see you've already found some ghosts...
  - Please release them at the monument so that they may rest peacefully.
  hasGhostsTalking:
  - Oh? I see you've found some ghosts...
  - Please release them at the monument so that they may rest peacefully.
  noGhostsTalking:
  - I wonder what the villagers think about these ghosts...
  noVillagersTalking:
  - Alas, the village has fallen empty. I fear there's no village for you to protect
    anymore...
  angryTalking:
  - How dare you show your face after murdering one of our own!
  - Prepare your final words before I strike you down
  introMonument:
  - So eager to explore our little village, you walked right past me!
  - Thank you for putting these ghosts to rest.
  - I can sense # more ghosts in this village
  introNoGhostsMonument:
  - Hello there, traveler. It seems like you've stumbled upon this cemetery's monument.
  - Our village has been plagued by restless ghosts as of late.
  - Please, subdue these ghosts and release them at this monument so that they may
    rest at last
  noGhostsMonument:
  - It appears you don't have any ghosts to release. Try collecting some and come
    back later.
  hasGhostsMonument:
  - 'Thank you for bringing these ghosts to rest, traveler. '
  - I can sense # more ghosts in this village
  noVillagersMonument:
  - 'Thank you for bringing these ghosts to rest, traveler. '
  - Alas, the village has fallen empty. I fear there's no village for you to protect
    anymore...
  angryMonument:
  - Releasing the ghosts of those you've murdered will not save you from retribution
  - You killed my villagers, prepare to die!!!
  winMonument:
  - It seems the village is peaceful again at last
  - Thank you for your help, traveler.
